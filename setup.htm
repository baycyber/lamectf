<h1>Using this Scoring Engine</h1>

<h2>What You Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Linux cloud server machine
<li>Some questions and answers for students
</ul>


<h2>Purpose</h2>

To easily create CTF-style gamified learning contests.
This system is designed to be simple and easy to set up.
It is probably not very secure--if you hack it, 
please let me know!


<h2>Server Setup</h2>

You need Apache and PHP.  

On Ubuntu 18.04, thee commands work:

<blockquote><b><nig><code><pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php
</pre></code></big></b></blockquote>
